This are some of the apps I had to install to make theming possible or
some are just apps that I like or use, maybe unrelated.
Keep an eye on those that have to do with themes or colors, kde, gnome, gtk, fvwm

NECESSARY
fvwm
wmctrl
rxvt-unicode (or edit config, supports transparency, unicode and ansi colors)
hsetroot (use default, or included fixed version)
 - necessary for the themes to work 
gtk-chtheme (using QtCurve)
gtk-theme-switch2  (using QtCurve)
systemsettings5 (workspace theme:Oxygen, application style:Oxygen, gnome application styles: (gtk2=QtCurve, gtk3=pytheme)
gtk-theme-config
kde-style-oxygen-qt4
kde-style-oxygen-qt5
plasma-theme-oxygen
gtk2-engines-qtcurve

IF NEEDED
stalonetray (if you need notifications or if you use the full panel, it shows in the panel)
xcompmgr (for transparency)
wm-icons (icons in menus)
fvwm-icons
xscreensaver-data
xscreensaver-data-extra
xscreensaver-gl
xscreensaver-gl-extra

ttf-unifont

   a uniform look
