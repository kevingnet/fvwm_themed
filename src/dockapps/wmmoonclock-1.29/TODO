Things TODO:
            - clean up code!
            - more detailed documentation.
            - reduce size of pixmap! Dont need it in one pixmap.
              Also, does the hi-color pixmap really need all those colors?
            - add rotation of moon so user sees it as they would in reality?
            - eclipses. The calcs are quite acurate so this should be
              easily doable.
              (Note the Sun position calcs in CalcEphem are low
              precision -- high is not as costly as the Moon calcs.)
              Sun posiiton is calculated but not used yet...
            - Next new moons, next full moons, next quarters, etc...
            - Moon name. I.e. Harvest, Blue, etc...
