Version 1.27 -	released June 7, 1999.
		fixed a minor bug in computation of azimuth (A in Horizon
		Coords). Thanks to Dan Moraru for spotting this one. (There were
		two SinGlat factors instead of one).

Version 1.26 -	released April 22, 1999 (?).
Version 1.25 -	released March 22, 1999.
		Now auto-detects 8-bit display and forces the LowColor pixmap to
		be used. The -low option still works if you need to conserve
		colors even on high-color displays.

		Added 3 command line options + code to change colors of the data
		entries:

			-bc <Color> to change background color.
			-lc <Color> to change color of labels and headers.
			-dc <Color> to change color of data values.

Version 1.24 -	released February 9, 1999.
		Added low color support via the -low command line option.

Version 1.23 -	released February 4, 1999.
		cosmetic for AfterStep users. removed spurious black line at
		RHS edge an mask.

Version 1.22 -	released January 8, 1999.
		+ Changed PI2 to TwoPi in Moon.c -- Linux Pyth. had probs
		  because PI2 was defined in <math.h>.

Version 1.21 -	released January 7, 1999.
		+ minor bug fixes in Makefile and manpage.

Version 1.2 - released January 3, 1999.
	      Added:
		+ Local Time/ Universal Time display.
		+ Visible: Yes/No to indicate if Moon is up or not.
		+ Frac (percent through orbit -- this is NOT a simple
		  conversion of AGE....).
		+ Horizon Coords. Altitude is measured up from horizon to
		  Moon in degrees. Azimuth is in degrees from due south.

	      Also shuffled things around a bit...

Version 1.1 - released December 24, 1998.
	      Fixed bug in AGE calculation. It now should be highly accurate.
	      Note that AGE is not the same as Phase*29.530589 ...
	      I have checked with the Astronomical Almanac and it agrees very
	      well....

Version 1.0 - released December 16, 1998.
