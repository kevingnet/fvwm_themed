          ------------------------------------------------

  wmhdplop is yet another monitoring applet. This one watches hard-drive
activity.
  gkhdplop is the port of wmhdplop into a gkrellm2 plugin.

Compilation:
-----------
  ./configure && make && make install

  Note that this applet uses Imlib2, and requires the script imlib2-config
to be in the path. It won't compile on anything but a recent linux kernel
(2.4.20 or better, 2.6 is also supported).

  gkhdplop requires gtk2 and gkrellm2.

Usage:
------
  wmhdplop -h for the list of options. If you have the hddtemp daemon running,
then wmhdplop may use it to display the temperature of your hard-drives.
  The monitored hard-drive or partition can be changed with the mouse wheel.

gkhdplop:
---------
  To install the plugin:
    mv gkhdplop.so ~/.gkrellm2/plugins

  The configuration is made by clicking with the right button on the plugin.
  BUG: gkhdplop will close gkrellm if no default .ttf font is found (look at
  the messages in console).
