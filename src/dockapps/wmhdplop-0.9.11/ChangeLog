	Should tolerate swapless configurations.

2005-02-25

	Damned there was a leak in both wmforkplop and wmhdplop.

2004-14-07 (v0.9.6)

	Small reduction of CPU consumption, and fixed a bug in gkhdplop
	which was under-estimating the throughtput.

	Added options --32, --48 and --56 for user whose dock is smaller
	than 64x64.

2004-07-07 (v0.9.5)

	Some small bugfixes, added /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/truetype to
	default font path, wmhdplop will try harder to find a
	font. gkhdplop won't kill gkrellm if not font is found. wmhdplop
	should work out of box with fvwm2 and others windowmanagers.

	http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=257760 should be
	fixed, and the font names/size can now be changed in the gkhdplop
	panel.

2004-04-06 (v0.9.4)

	Well well well, wmhdplop won't try anymore to parse device
	names. Major & minor device number are the only truth. Forget the
	brain-damaged 0.9.3 which was broken with devfs.

2004-04-06 (v0.9.3)

	Fixed some crashes, and wrong throughput when partitions where
	monitored.  wmhdplop should recognize automatically scsi drives,
	and even raid arrays.

2004-04-01

	The release that will rule the desktops \o/ (v0.9.2) Add mouse
	interactivity.  Add gkhdplop, the port to gkrellm.  wmhdplop
	-g=wxh is not resizable

2003-12-18

	Improved release \o/ (v0.9.1) Many internal changes. The
	dockapp/imlib2 initialisation part was moved to a separate file,
	which should be reusable.  All option names were changed.. -F is
	now --fontpath, -f is --smallfont etc..  The --geometry option was
	added in order to launch wmhdplop in undocked mode, with an
	arbitray window size. This option has to be used with the
	gnome-swallow meta applet (see example on the homepage).  The
	default font-paths are now scanned recursively.

2003-12-06

	Initial release \o/ (v0.9.0)
