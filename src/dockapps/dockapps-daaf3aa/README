|O|  About wmclock  |X|
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wmclock is an applet which displays the date and time in a dockable
tile in the same style as the clock from the NEXTSTEP(tm) operating
system.  Wmclock is specially designed for the Window Maker window
manager, by Alfredo Kojima, and features multiple language support,
twenty-four-hour and twelve-hour (am/pm) time display, and, optionally,
can run a user-specified program on a mouse click.  Wmclock is derived
from asclock, a similar clock for the AfterStep window manager.

Please see the INSTALL file accompanying the wmclock source for
instructions on installing wmclock.

|O|  Getting Started  |X|
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wmclock is designed especially for Window Maker; hence, putting wmclock
into your Window Maker dock is quick and easy.  After you've installed
wmclock according to the instructions, there are three steps:

  (1) Start wmclock.  The easiest way to accomplish this is to accept
      the defaults for things such as led color, blinking, etc, and
      just start the clock:

          wmclock

  (2) Drag the resulting wmclock appicon to an empty slot in your dock.
      You can do this in one of two fashions:

      (a) Position the mouse pointer over a portion of the appicon tile
          that is not covered by wmclock's LED display or calendar
          display.  Press the primary mouse button (usually the left
          one) and drag to the dock.  This requires a little bit of
          precision in aiming the mouse, but requires no keyboard
          action.

      (b) Hold down the [Alt] or [Meta] key (whichever one you have
          configured Window Maker to use), position the mouse pointer
          over any part of the wmlock appicon, press the primary mouse
          button (usually the left one), and drag to the dock. This
          method requires less precision, but requires you to press and
          hold a key while dragging.

  (3) Set wmclock to launch when Window Maker starts.  Press the menu
      mouse button (usually the right one) on the portion of the docked
      wmclock tile that is not covered by wmclock's LED display or
      calendar display to bring up the dock icon menu, and choose
      `Settings...'.  In the resulting dialog, check the box labelled
      `Start when Window Maker is started' and press `OK'.  That's it!

|O|  Troubleshooting  |X|
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As with any dockable applet, there are a few possible `gotchas' with
wmclock and Window Maker:

  - If you have the Clip set to `AutoAttract Icons', the wmclock
    appicon will appear in the Clip instead of on the desktop.  If your
    Clip is collapsed, you won't be able to see the wmclock appicon,
    even though it's running.  Make sure you uncollapse your Clip and
    look for wmclock there if it doesn't appear on your desktop.

  - If your Clip is too close to your dock, you may have difficulty
    docking wmclock, because the Clip may grab the wmclock appicon
    instead.  Try moving your Clip farther away from your dock before
    docking wmclock.

|O|  Differences Between asclock and wmclock  |X|
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wmclock is derived from asclock version 1.0.12 by Beat Christen.
The major differences between asclock and wmclock are:

  (1) Asclock is designed for use with the AfterStep window manager.
      To use asclock with Window Maker, a patch is required.  Wmclock
      is better behaved with Window Maker and requires no patch or
      special command-line options; it `just works'.

  (2) Wmclock corrects a few of asclock's aesthetic defects.  Most
      notably, the `off-by-one-pixel' defect at the lefthand side of
      the LED display is corrected.

  (3) Asclock use a simple system() call to execute the command
      specified using the `-exe' command-line option; this method could
      create lots of unwanted zombie processes.  Wmclock cleans up its
      chiled processes every so often to eliminate the zombies.

      Also, if no command was specified when asclock was started, it
      would output a message warning that no command was specified each
      time you click the mouse on asclock window area.  Wmclock does not
      output that message; if no command was specified, wmclock simply
      does nothing when you click on it.

Other minor differences include:

  (1) The `-shape' and `-iconic' command-line options are no longer
      needed with wmclock.  Wmclock recognizes them for backwards
      compatibility with asclock, but they have no effect.

  (2) Asclock contained an arbitrary limitation on the length of the
      command (approximately 50 characters) that you could specify with
      the `-exe' option.  Wmclock removes that arbitrary limitation and
      cleans up the code significantly in the process.
