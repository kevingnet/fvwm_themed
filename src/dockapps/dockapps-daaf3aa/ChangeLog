	* Bump to version 1.0.16.

	* configure.ac, wmclock.1.in: Get manpage date from ChangeLog instead
	of manually updating.

	* configure.ac, wmclock.c: Use defines to get language xpms instead of
	creating symlinks.

	* wmclock.c: Fix "comparison between signed and unsigned integer"
	warnings.

2014-12-11  Doug Torrance <dtorrance@monmouthcollege.edu>

	* Bump to version 1.0.15.

	* INSTALL, README, configure.ac:  Update documentation.
	In particular, document installation changes after switch to
	autotools and change maintainer to Window Maker Developers.

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, wmclock.1.in, wmclock.man.in:
	Update manpage.

	Changes include:
	- Rename to wmclock.1.
	- Use @prefix@ instead of /usr for the location of the language xpm
	files.
	- Hardcode date instead of picking it up from a variable in the
	Makefile.

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, month.xpm,	weekday.xpm:
	Choose language with ./configure.

	This is a feature that was present in the pre-autotools configure
	script.  Note a syntax change:
	./configure --lang foo
	is now
	./configure --with-lang=foo
	Also remove the .xpm files in the root directory, as they are
	created during configuration.

2014-12-10  Doug Torrance <dtorrance@monmouthcollege.edu>

	* Updated documentation to show new maintainer.

2010-12-03 20:28  brucec
	* Imakefile: Bumped version to 1.0.13, add warning flags.

	* INSTALL: Updated compiler and flags example.

	* wmclock.c, weekday.xpm: Integrated Debian nopolling patch and
	FreeBSD's weekday and year patches. Added function prototypes.

	* wmclock.spec.in: Add ChangeLog to %%doc directory.

	* Imakefile: Bump version to 1.0.12.2.	Release.

	* Imakefile: Generate changelog from CVS comments with 'make
	changelog'.  Add generated changelog to distribution tarball.

	* Imakefile: `tar' target was copying CVS directories.
	Restructured it a bit to avoid that.

	* Imakefile: `distclean' target could prove troublesome by
	destroying irreproducible work.

	* wmclock.spec.in: Oops.  Missed an obsolete %%{ReleaseNum} macro.

2000-03-08 07:35  jmknoble

	* Imakefile, wmclock.spec.in: Added template from which to generate
	spec file (wmclock.spec.in).  Added targets in Imakefile to handle
	generating the spec file.  Revised `tar' target to rebuild on
	sourcefile change.  Added distclean target.  Removed symlinks from
	tarball.  Updated version to 1.0.12.1.

	* .cvsignore: Added .cvsignore file for convenience of the
	developer.

	* Makefile: Makefile is automagically generated; it shouldn't be
	stored in CVS.

	* wmclock.c, xpm/mask.xbm: Compiling with gcc -Wall -ansi -pedantic
	revealed that the mask bitmap should be declared as unsigned char.
	XCreateBitmapFromData() expects char *, though, so we cast the mask
	bitmap data explicitly.

	* dynlist.c, dynlist.h: Fixed possible memory leak.
