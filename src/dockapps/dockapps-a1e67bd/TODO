Just some brainstorming:


	+ Add multiple "pages" like wmMoonClock?

	+ Eclipse info?

	+ Twilight Calcs. Civil, Astro, Nautical....

	+ Transit time?

	+ Graphical Annalemma or plot of Eq of Time...

	+ Add user definable twiddle factor to account for local
	  terrain etc.. Could even go way overbaord and download
	  USGS topo info? (Man! that is going overboard!).

	+ etc..
