TAR zip files are originals

Extracted files have modified versions of bitmap files so that 
the ugly gray lines do not show. Otherwise your nice theme will
be polluted by this usually out of place color.

The modified files are *.xpm, all the rest should be exactly
as the originals.

The files in wmnet are a mess, because in order to build and install
it was necessary to patch. All that is included in that directory.

The applications here are used in the default fvwm config file 
and are shown in the bottom right corner panel.

The quick way is to simply copy the files in bin over to /usr/bin and 
overwrite the originals.

Otherwise, you can enter each directory and build them yourself and then 
install them in the standard way.
