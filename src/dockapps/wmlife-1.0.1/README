Wmlife
------

Wmlife is a dock app running Conway's Game of Life. Life is played on a grid of
square cells where a cell can be either live or dead. In the rules, you count
the number of live neighbours for each cell to determinies whether a cell
lives or dies.

+ A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (birth).
+ A live cell with two or three live neighbors stays alive (survival).
+ In all other cases, a cell dies or remains dead (overcrowding or loneliness).

Normally Life is implemented on a infinite board but due to size restraints
wmlife implements the grid as a torus. In a torus the grid wraps at the edges
from top to bottom and left to right.

Wmlife was based on the Gnome Life applet which has been sadly purged by
zealous Gnome developers. The algorithim in wmlife is faster but not as
fast as some out there, however it is only a 56x56 grid. Clicking on the
dock results in the following.

* Left click to run a program
* Middle click to randmoise the grid
* Right click to pause
* Mouse wheel up or down launches a glider at mouse co-ordinates

This uses the GDK libraries and should be portable to most Unix architectures
with the Gnome enviroment.

The original GDK dock app came from the ubercool wmfishtime dock application
written by timecop over at http://www.ne.jp/asahi/linux/timecop/ which has
swimming fish, an anti-aliased analog clock, and alpha blended bubbles.
Using this is much faster than the historic wmgeneral source.

Unlike wmfishtime (or wmufo or wmfire), this program is not afflicted by the
broken window manager problem as since it only draws once or twice per second
I've let it redraw both source GCs for win and iconwin.

If you discover any bugs then please report them to me at
