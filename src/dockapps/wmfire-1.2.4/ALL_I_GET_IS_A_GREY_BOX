In the words of the author of wmfishtime without whom this program would not
have been made :-)

"If you get a gray box and nothing else after you start this dockapp, you
have a retarded broken window manager such as E, recent versions of the KDE
window manager, etc. Remember that if you get this your system totally sucks
ass, and you have to use "-b" option to fix this. If you feel offended by
this, make sure and let developers of E and KWM know that they suck."

All the old style dock apps that use wmgeneral source actually redraw both
source GCs for win and iconwin. However, they only refresh once or twice a
second...
