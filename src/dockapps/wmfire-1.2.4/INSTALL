on the command line before running configure;

export CFLAGS="-O2 -march=i686"

Please note that I cannot get session management to work properly. It uses
the same session management code as GKrellM so should work...
                                                                                
I get two scenarios depending if I create windows before registering session
or vice versa;
 
1) The SM_CLIENT_ID isn't set and when logging out Metacity complains that
the dock is not a session managed app, while the session manager doesn't
seem to setup the restart commands with the old session ID.
 
2) The SM_CLIENT_ID is set, but the dock doesn't register with the session
manager and causes the session manager to "hang" waiting for the dock to
register for two minutes. This prevents logging out for those two minutes.
 
Answers on a postcard.
