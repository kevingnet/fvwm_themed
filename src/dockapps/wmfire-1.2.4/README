Wmfire
------

Wmfire is a flaming dock app which can monitor your cpu, memory, or network
load. It features;

+ Monitor cpu load
+ Monitor memory load
+ Monitor net load
+ Monitor file value

* Left click to change the status monitor (unless locked)
* Middle click to hide/show nice'd process on cpu load
* Right click to change flame colour (unless locked)
* Mouse wheel up or down is the same as left click

On mouse over the cursor will disappear and be replaced by a burning spot
at that location. After two seconds symbols will be burnt to represent what
is being monitored. For cpu, a short solid bar for average load, or a line
of dots representing the current cpu number on SMP systems. For the memory,
a 4x4 grid of dots is used to signify a memory array. For the network, a
line of marching dots is like data passing through a cable. For file
values, a spinning disk platter is shown.

(Note that not all window managers support all mouse over effects.)

This uses the GDK and libgtop libraries and should be portable to most Unix
architectures with the Gnome enviroment.

The original GDK routine came from the ubercool wmfishtime dock application
written by timecop over at http://www.ne.jp/asahi/linux/timecop/ which has
swimming fish, an anti-aliased analog clock, and alpha blended bubbles.
Using this is much faster than the historic wmgeneral source.

Like wmfishtime, this program is afflicted by the broken window manager
problem. So if you get a grey box use the "-b" option.

If you discover any bugs then please report them to me at
