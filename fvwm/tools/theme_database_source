# Theme descriptor file. 
# - Two colors miminum, codes can be included in the color, see it's python file for information
# - @Menu name, the @ symbol is used to start a menu entry
# - Then a list of colors would follow, a color must be in the format (#RRGGBBAA) and the code can preceed the # symbol
# - The tool will try to match an image file which will be searched and an icon file will be created for the menu entry
#   if the file is not found an icon file will be created (by another tool) based on the colors.
# - For some themes you may want to group the icon file for several color configurations, that is one icon to a set of
#   colors, for that add an entry, something like 'vintagebluepat -nop' this will cause the theme menu to show an icon file
#   which hopefully can be found in textures, and then several entries of the form
#   vintagebluepat (#a08040FF) (#c08060FF) (#c0a060FF) (#a06040FF) -skip
#   notice that it ends with -skip, this instructs the tool, not to look for an image file and instead create an icon based
#   on the listed colors
# - The tool will create a json file with the information from this file, it will also create a .txt file that contains a 
#   theme index and name, also the menu names to group them.
# Empty line terminates processing.
