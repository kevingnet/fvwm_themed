tools image_* will generate menu entries:
image_palette_dir_2_theme_list will add them to theme_database_source_palette, and
image_algorithm_dir_2_theme_list will add them to theme_database_source_algorithm

The first one needs image files that already have been processed, the number of colors
in the palette have been reduced to 2 to 8, the algorithm will choose the first 4.

The second one can be fed with as many colors and tries to figure out the ones 'we want' 
to use for our theme

Both generate a menu entry header which simply shows the image icon and 4 menu entries
with generated color icons, with the chosen colors.

The steps to add menu entries are:
1) Process an image file using one of the tools above, or simply add an entry with the
   colors you want in your theme, no image necessary, an icon will be created.
2) If you add them manually add them to theme_database_source, otherwise, copy them 
   from the files named above to theme_database_source
3) Run theme_database_regenerate.py, this will recreate scripts/data/colors.json which
   contains data to be used for menu generation.
4) Run theme_menu_regenerate.py, this will recreate files ColorsMenu, ColorsMenuList and
   ColorsThemeList. These files are read by .fvwm/config and included and are the theme
   menu entries you'd see.
